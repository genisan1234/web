<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This demo application has been designed to showcase the accessibility features of many of the Oracle JET components.
<ul>
<li>The Introduction page illustrates the use of a TabBar with each tab illustrating how to display data in different styles.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Organization tab will show the data in a TreeView.</li>
<li>The Employees tab shows the data in a master/detail/detail format.</li>
